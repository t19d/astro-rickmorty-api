## 📄 Project Structure

Here's an overview of the project structure:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

The app uses Astro to look for .astro files in the src/pages/ directory, which are exposed as routes based on their file names. The src/components/ directory is where we keep our Astro components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the public/ directory.
